1. make a starting screen that shows the title of the game, the start button, and the "2 player gamemode" option
2. make the normal game (single player)
2a. add more elements to the normal game to make it less bland
2b. ex: sound effects, visual effects, more screen decorations, maybe nyan cat can be on right or left side of the screen encouraging the player
3. somehow make the 2 player gamemode, basically 2 screens where one is controlled with the arrow keys and the other is controled with WASD
4. maybe add a diff gamemode/easter egg idk
