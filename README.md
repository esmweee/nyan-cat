This is a Nyan Cat themed platformer game that I made using
mainly Javascript and HTML (also like two lines of code just for CSS to load the fonts lol). 
It's really simple, you just use your mouse (or spacebar, but I reccomend mouse) to make
Nyan Cat jump and collect as many poptarts as you can. Theres no ending so your goal
is to catch as many as possible!
I made this project because it's something that I've been wanting to make ever since I signed up for 
GWC but kept putting it off since I didn't know how to do it. I struggled a lot with learning how to
generate random objects since I had never done it before, but random videos on Youtube helped me a lot!
